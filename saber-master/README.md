Developing desktop like JavaScript Application integrating [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/).

You can treat it as something like a tiny [Durandal](http://www.durandaljs.com/), but more flexible and more lightweight. 

Actually, its `widget` data-binding syntax is exactly the same as Durandal.   

This project is in active development. We don't recommend to use it so far.
